<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p id="Abstract">
The use of 3D printing as a form of additive manufacture has been vital to mechanical engineering over the course of its existence. This article will outline the history, development and how 3D printing is currently used. 3D printing is an important tool when being used to prototype for engineering, it allows for scale tests for a reduced cost and reduces the cost drastically when compared to CNC machined parts. This has greatly improved the speeds that engineers can work at. It can also be used for soft robotics due to its ability to form compliant mechanisms.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p id="Introduction">

For the past 40 years since Dr. Hido Kodama <ex1><a href="#ref1">(Chapman, A. (2022).)</a></ex1> invented one of the first rapid prototyping machines, which formed its prints layer by layer with resin hardened by UV light.  In 1989 Scott Crump patented Fused Deposition Modelling (see figure 1), the basis for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) or what most people would consider conventional 3d printing. Since this point 3D printing slowly evolved until 2004. In 2005 the rise of an open-source initiative founded by Dr. Adrian Bowyer, The RepRap Project, a 3d printer capable of self-replicating. “RepRap is thus a kinematic assisted self-replicating self-manufacturing machine.” <ex1><a href="#ref2">(‌Jones, R. et al. (2009).)</a></ex1>, this allowed enthusiasts to get their hands on 3d printers for the first time as the cost associated dropped from thousands to about £500, this changed the widespread ownership as owning a 3D printer was outside the budget of most enthusiasts.

  <h3>Analysis and discussion</h3>
<p id="Analysis and discussion">
3D printing has revolutionised the Mechanical engineering industry, the use of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) has greatly: sped up the production, decreased the cost and improved the accuracy of iterative prototyping. Designs can be created in CAD software; this has greatly improved the design iteration as part of the design process as prototypes can be produced at every stage of its developmental journey. 
  
Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), a form of additive manufacturing allows for the 3D printing of metal, this has allowed engineers to finalise designs with highly accurate parts made from iron, stainless steel and titanium alloys. This has reduced the need for cnc machines, which often require highly skilled workers which increases lead times for metal parts.  The price of CNC is incredibly high as it is a reductive manufacturing process, this requires a blank much larger than the object, which is then reduced, producing waste, which is often disposed of as scrap, this can often be greater than 50% of the material used for the blank. The wear on the toolheads that remove the material is also a very expensive as CNC machine cutting bits are often made from high-speed steel and tungsten carbide which have high costs due to their complicated manufacturing process. Decreased complexity allows for easier maintenance as General Electric aircraft fuel nozzles used to consist of 25 individual pieces but now can be formed from one <ex1><a href="#ref3">(‌Sheng, R. (2022).).</a></ex1> this has also increased the strength of the device fivefold. Quality control takes a shorter amount of time as the whole device can be replaced as a single part if there is a failure or fault with its mechanism.
